# Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Options

### 1. Netlify (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard
5. Deploy!

### 2. Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel`
3. Follow prompts
4. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### 3. Manual Static Hosting

1. Run: `npm run build`
2. Upload `dist/` folder contents to your web server
3. Configure environment variables on your hosting platform

## Environment Variables for Production

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING

**IMPORTANT**: Vite environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are embedded into the client-side bundle and are visible to anyone who inspects your website. **Never put real API keys in `VITE_` environment variables for production deployments.**

### For Demo/Showcase Deployment (Recommended):

```env
VITE_APP_MODE=demo
```

This is the **recommended approach** for most deployments. Demo mode:
- ‚úÖ Works without API keys
- ‚úÖ No security risks
- ‚úÖ Shows realistic mock responses
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates all functionality perfectly

### For Production with Live AI (NOT RECOMMENDED for client-side apps):

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This exposes your API key to all website visitors!

```env
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
VITE_OPENROUTER_MODEL=moonshotai/kimi-k2
VITE_APP_MODE=production
```

### Secure Alternative for Live AI:

For production use with real AI, implement a backend API that:
1. Keeps API keys server-side
2. Provides a secure endpoint for your frontend
3. Implements rate limiting and authentication

**Recommendation**: Use demo mode for showcases and implement a proper backend for production use with real API keys.
